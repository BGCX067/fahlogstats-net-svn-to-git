ToDo:

1) Optimising parser even further -- if you manage to achieve 15%+ speed-up
then please email me (alexc@majestic12.co.uk) your version for release to
everybody.

2) Making NUnit test cases
 
3) Better support for Unicode

4) Build-in re-encoding of text to required encoding

5) Better documentation/comments

6) Perhaps a conditional compile statement to get a version of HTMLparser
that will deal with all range checks etc.
