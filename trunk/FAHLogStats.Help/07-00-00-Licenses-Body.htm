<H2>Licenses</H2>
<P>The only license under which this program is made available is the GNU GPL (sometimes abbreviated
as just "The GPL") version 2. While many applications are made available under version 2 "and any later
version", I have chosen to release only under version 2 at this stage.</P>
<P>Once Version 3 of the GPL has been finalised and published, I will make a decision on whether the
code will be released under both versions of the GPL.</P>
<P>While the GPL serves a wonderful purpose, I do not agree with the FSF's assertion that they should
be able to alter the license on my code without my approval. This is the case with the stock standard GPL.</P>
<P>You must therefore abide by version 2 of the GNU GPL. No later version can be substituted at this time.</P>
